# About Me

## Work

I'm currently a data scientist at Seagate Technology in Shakopee, MN. There, I work on analyzing and modeling
hard drive failures.

Before I made the transition to data science, I was an experimental particle physicist. While working on my PhD, I analyzed data from the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. I also did a brief stint as a Postdoctoral Associate at Cornell, where I designed reconstruction algorithms and wrote firmware for the upcoming [Muon g&minus;2](http://muon-g-2.fnal.gov) experiment at Fermilab.

## Education

![]({{site.url}}/files/img/phd_ceremony.jpg)

I earned my Ph.D. in Experimental Particle Phyiscs from <span itemprop="alumniOf">Cornell University</span> in 2014, working under Prof. Jim Alexander. My dissertation research was carried out using the [CMS](http://cms.cern.ch) experiment on the Large Hadron Collider at [CERN](http://cern.ch). I studied applications of 
kinematic endpoint variables such as M<sub>T2</sub> and M<sub>CT</sub> for measuerments of particle properties and searches for new physics. You can find my dissertation and the papers that came from this work over at [Publications]({{ site.url }}/publications).

I did my undergraduate work at the <span itemprop="alumniOf">University of Minnesota &ndash; Twin Cities</span>, where I graduated Summa Cum Laude in 2009 with B.S. in Physics. While there, I did a variety of particle-physics-related research under Prof. Roger Rusack, including work on the CMS and [NO&nu;A](http://www-nova.fnal.gov) experiments.


## Hobbies

I love learning new things, so I dabble in lots of hobbies. I enjoy learning new technologies, including programming languages, framweorks, and machine learning techniques. I occasionally dabble in machine learning competitions over at [Kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com). I've also been working off and on at rebuilding mechanical watches.

I spend a fair amount of time on strength training, although I'm still a novice. I've had a lot of success with the methods outlined in Mark Rippetoe's book [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.com). That said, basically any method that's based upon linear progression of compound movements ought to work just as well.
