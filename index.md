# About Me

## Work

I'm currently a data scientist at Target in Minneapolis, MN. I work on a wide variety of things, including deep neural networks, marketing attribution, and large-scale graph algorithms. Among other things, I make heavy use of [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org) and [Tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org).

Previously, I worked at Seagate Technology in Shakopee, MN. There, I work on analyzing, modeling, and predicting hard drive failures.

Before I made the transition to data science, I was an experimental particle physicist. While working on my PhD, I analyzed data from the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. I also did a brief stint as a Postdoctoral Associate at Cornell, where I designed reconstruction algorithms and wrote firmware for the upcoming [Muon g&minus;2](http://muon-g-2.fnal.gov) experiment at Fermilab.

## Education

I earned my Ph.D. in Experimental Particle Phyiscs from <span itemprop="alumniOf">Cornell University</span> in 2014, working under Prof. Jim Alexander. My dissertation research was carried out using the [CMS](http://cms.cern.ch) experiment on the Large Hadron Collider at [CERN](http://cern.ch). I studied applications of 
kinematic endpoint variables such as M<sub>T2</sub> and M<sub>CT</sub> for measuerments of particle properties and searches for new physics. You can find my dissertation and the papers that came from this work over at [Publications]({{ site.url }}/publications).

I did my undergraduate work at the <span itemprop="alumniOf">University of Minnesota &ndash; Twin Cities</span>, where I graduated Summa Cum Laude in 2009 with B.S. in Physics. While there, I did a variety of particle-physics-related research under Prof. Roger Rusack, including work on the CMS and [NO&nu;A](http://www-nova.fnal.gov) experiments.


## Hobbies

I love learning new things, so I dabble in lots of hobbies. I enjoy learning new technologies, including programming languages, framweorks, and machine learning techniques. I spend a fair amount of time on strength training, and might someday do a powerlifting meet. I also enjoy board games and reading, mostly sci-fi.
