## matplotlib

![]({{site.url}}/files/img/matplotlib_hist.png)

I've made a number of contributions to the open-source [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) plotting library for Python. Most of my work has been related to the histogram functionality, as I used it heavily during my work in particle physics. The above plot is from one of my CMS [publications]({{site.url}}/publications), and shows several of the features I implemented, including stacked histograms and fixes to logarithmic axis scales.
